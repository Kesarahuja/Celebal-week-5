## ⚙️ Workflow Overview

### 📊 1. Data Preprocessing
- Handled missing values
- Encoded categorical features
- Outlier detection and removal
- Feature scaling

### 🧠 2. Feature Engineering
- Created new interaction features
- Log-transformed skewed variables
- One-hot encoding for nominal categories

### 🤖 3. Model Development
- Split the data into training and test sets
- Trained models such as:
  - Linear Regression
  - Ridge / Lasso Regression
  - Random Forest Regressor
- Evaluated using metrics like RMSE and R² Score
